    <h3>RESTful Data Services with LinkRest : Building / Securing / Optimizing</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-0">Andrus Adamchik</a></p>
    <p><a href="http://linkrest.io" target="_blank">LinkRest</a> is a small HTTP-based protocol and a Java framework that rethinks how REST APIs should be built. It turns each API endpoint into a graph query engine, giving client full control over the shape and contents of the requested data sets. The talk will start with the easy parts – how to reuse an existing ORM model (Apache Cayenne) and write simple Java one-liners to get a REST service up and running. Then we will delve into more advanced topics: alternative backends, graph access security and parallel data processing.</p>

    <h3>Building WebSockets Gaming Applications using the Atmosphere Framework</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-1">Jean-Francois Arcand</a>, <a href="#speaker-2">Jeremie Papillon</a></p>
    <p>This session will illustrate the Atmosphere Framework's concepts by building a reactive gaming application using WebSockets, Atmosphere, React Native and the Netty I/O Framework. First, we will explain how to implement an Atmosphere's WebSocketProcessor API as a foundation for a real time gaming application. Second, we will demonstrate how to use javax.inject for building injection of any kind of objects inside our WebSocketProcessor. Next we will use Doodgame, a real time gaming application developped by Yulplay.com, available on IOS and Android, to demonstrate how quickly a client can be build hooked to our new WebSocketProcessor. We will conclude with performance tips and tricks when building WebSocket applications using Atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Weird Stream API</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-3">Tagir Valeev</a></p>
    <p>Java 8 Stream API is already here for a couple of years and programmers use it widely. However under the hood of magical API you can discover the plain Java code with has its own bugs, weirdness and whims. We will take a look on some code snippets which may unexpectedly show poor performance or strange behavior. Also we will extend Stream API with new intermediate operation trying to achieve the best performance.</p>

    <h3>HotSpot Intrinsics</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-4">Volker Simonis</a></p>
    <p>By definition, intrinsics are functions which are handled specially by the compiler or the VM. The HotSpot virtual machine supports intrinsics for specific API functions in the interpreter as well as in the C1 and C2 JIT compilers. In general, intrinsics are a great possibility for optimization. But they also come at a certain cost. <br/> <br/> First of all, they are inherently platform and implementation dependent. If available, they can lead to consistency problems if they are implemented differently in the interpreter and the JIT compilers. Finally, they can change the program control (e.g. safepoint behavior) and observability (e.g. profiling, instrumentation) in subtle ways. <br/> <br/> This talk will give you a short deep dive into the HotSpot Virtual Machine using the example of HotSpot intrinsics. It will explain how they are implemented and the implications this has for the Java VM. Finally, it will demonstrate how you can add a new intrinsic for your favorite Java method.</p>

    <h3>RxJava in legacy projects</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-5">Tomasz Nurkiewicz</a></p>
    <p>If you ever approached RxJava before you might come to a conclusion that this library solves problems most of us don't have. Reactively composing streams of data, virtual time, marble diagrams and event-driven programming - where most of our code is pretty much just transferring data from database to presentation layer. <br/> During this live coding session there will not be a single slide, we start with empty IDE to step-by-step implement key constructs in RxJava. Most importantly we will discover how this high-level abstraction can help in existing projects. When to use RxJava, what problems does it solve and when using it is an excess of form over substance. <br/> We will learn how to build highly reliable and concurrent applications, improve throughput and resource utilization without hurting readability and avoiding complexity.</p>

    <h3>Full-Text Search Explained</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-7">Philipp Krenn</a></p>
    <p>Today’s applications are expected to provide powerful full-text search. But how does that work in general and how do I implement it on my site or in my application? <br/> Actually, this is not as hard as it sounds at first. This talk covers: <ul><li> How full-text search works in general and what the differences to databases are. </li> <li> How the score or quality of a search result is calculated. </li> <li> How to implement this with Elasticsearch. </li> </ul> Attendees will learn how to add common search patterns to their applications without breaking a sweat.</p>

    <h3>Java 8 Support at the JVM Level</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-8">Nikita Lipsky</a></p>
    <p>Java SE 8 has brought lambdas, default methods, type annotations, compact profiles, etc. As a result, the Java SE platform specification was changed to reflect new features. <br/> The session shows how the new Java 8 features have been implemented in Excelsior JET JVM, written from scratch, very different from the Oracle HotSpot JVM, but compatible with the Java SE specification. <br/> As a result, an attendee will refresh his/her memory regarding new Java 8 features, will learn how they affected the JVM specification, how the lambda expressions are translated into Java bytecode and how they can be optimized at the JVM level.</p>

    <h3>How shit works: the CPU</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-9">Tomer Gabel</a></p>
    <p>The beautiful thing about software engineering is that it gives you the warm and fuzzy illusion of total understanding: I control this machine because I know how it operates. This is the result of layers upon layers of successful abstractions, which hide immense sophistication and complexity. As with any abstraction, though, these sometimes leak, and that's when a good grounding in what's under the hood pays off. <br/> <br/> The second talk in this series peels a few layers of abstraction and takes a look under the hood of our "car engine", the CPU. While hardly anyone codes in assembly language anymore, your C# or JavaScript (or Scala or...) application still ends up executing machine code instructions on a processor; that is why Java has a memory model, why memory layout still matters at scale, and why you're usually free to ignore these considerations and go about your merry way. <br/> <br/> You'll come away knowing a little bit about a lot of different moving parts under the hood; after all, isn't understanding how the machine operates what this is all about?</p>

    <h3>Immutable Infrastructure: Rise of the Machine Images</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-10">Axel Fontaine</a></p>
    <p>The cloud is the new normal and it is time to rethink how we see machines and deployments. We have been piling layer upon layer of complexity for too long. But why should it be this way? It is time to radically simplify all this. <br/> <br/> In this talk, we'll throw general-purpose operating systems, snowflake servers and runtime provisioning out the door. Instead you'll see how servers become disposable, how machine images are generated from scratch in seconds and how to achieve perfect environment parity from dev to prod. <br/> <br/> This is Immutable Infrastructure. It is a profoundly important change as to how we view and treat our systems. We'll go deep. We'll look at how this affects scaling, logging, sessions, configuration, service discovery and more. We'll also look at how containers and machine images compare and why some things you took for granted may not be necessary anymore. <br/> But beware, neither sacred cows nor kittens will be spared!</p>

    <h3>DROP DATABASE - galactic story</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-11">Jaroslaw Ratajski</a></p>
    <p>So You thought databases might be useful. I will show You why this is ridiculous idea. <br/> Database is just the thing that kill performance of you system (100 times), destroys design and pollutes code. Besides it causes a great loss of information. Really, if you care about your data do not make a mistake and do not put them into Tables, JSONs or whatever. You can do it better. <br/> During the presentations you will see how to code systems NORMALLY and compare it to weird things such as Hibernate or JPA. You will learn that best place for your data is RAM !!! :-)  And this all from the guy who was writing JEE systems with SQL (and not only) for the last 15 years. This guy (me) was even kind of evangelist for JEE, and introduced Hibernate and JPA in a few companies. (I am do sorry for that). And we will be talking about facts. Code is <a href="https://github.com/airomem/galakpizza" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p>

    <h3>JDBC based frameworks racing</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-12">Vladislav Zablotsky</a></p>
    <p>There are more and more JDBC based frameworks each year every one of them promote itself as modern, fast and better than others in any way. But how all this can be applied in real life? Do we really know what price with respect to performance for next “more handy tool”? I’ve tried to test most popular frameworks against each other: native JDBC, EclipseLink, Hibernate, SpringJDBC, SpringData, MyBatis etc.</p>

    <h3>No container: a Modern Java Stack with Bootique</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-0">Andrus Adamchik</a></p>
    <p>Java containers appeared back in the era of big expensive hardware and monolithic applications, and currently feel like an impediment to Java progress. More and more people opt out of containers in favor of runnable jars, especially with the advance of microservices architectures. Andrus Adamchik will present a new open source tool called <a href="https://github.com/nhl/bootique" target="_blank">Bootique</a>, a pluggable and extensible technology intended for various kinds of container-less Java apps - REST services, webapps, job runners, desktop apps and what not.</p>

    <h3>An Immutable Object-Oriented Web Framework</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-13">Yegor Bugayenko</a></p>
    <p>JSP, JSF, Spring, Play, Spark and many other web development frameworks are very popular, but very procedural. They don't really respect the principles of encapsulation, they are full of static methods, setters-and-getters, singletons, NULL references, and other OOP anti-patterns. Using that frameworks turn us into procedural programmers writing in Java syntax. Takes.org is a young project that is making an attempt to change the landscape of Java web frameworks, but introducing an immutable and truly OOP design into it.</p>

    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-14">Baruch Sadogursky</a>, <a href="#speaker-15">Kirill Tolkachev</a></p>
    <p>Did you think that we were out of puzzlers?! Well, we might be - but the Groovy community sure isn't! Per usual, we've got a bunch of awesomely puzzling contributions and you are going to have a shot at winning one of the prizes. Attend this session to have some fun while getting a workout in for those muscles - you'll tease your brain and then stretch out for the flying t-shirts too!</p>

    <h3>Standardize Caching in Java: JCache</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-16">Alparslan Avci</a></p>
    <p>The JCache is the new standardized Java caching layer API which is specified by the Java Community Process (JCP) as Java Specification Request (JSR) 107. It provides a common way for applications to use and adopt caching thus allowing developers to focus on application development and avoid the burden of implementing caches themselves. In this presentation, we will give an overview of the API itself at a glance and see what JCache brings us. Also some tips will be shared for developers which will use JCache in their applications. Lastly, a simple demo will be run to make the audience understand JCache better by using a vendor implementation of the API.</p>

    <h3>Hadoop Jungle: the world of wild algorithms and poisonous JVMs</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-17">Alexey Zinoviev</a></p>
    <p>If you think that all deals with Hadoop cluster is only MapReduce job and Hive queries writing, you are mistaken. Incomplete utilization of JVM resources leads to the development degradation. As a result you will fire into the air a wad of money each time when your read or shuffle your data. <br/> Let's put on a pith helmet, getting vaccinated against arrogance and go chop vines of nonoptimal solutions. <br/> We'll go to the jungle and tamed the wild elephant Hadoop. Afterwards we will give an overview of different JOIN implementations. Also we'll obtain power over the redirection of data to different partitions. <br/> Okay, but seriously, during this lecture we will discuss following things: <ul><li>Hadoop and HDFS daemons as a typical Java - applications</li><li>Hadoop Java API Features</li><li>YARN containerization approach</li><li>The limits of customization in Hadoop</li><li>Different approaches to the implementation of the JOIN</li><li>Directed acyclic graph (DAG) of MR jobs</li><li>Performance tips</li><li>JVM settings what you really need</li><li>Development, debugging and testing phases</li></ul> This topic is the best choice for anyone who already know all the hassle with BigData and has some experience with the Hadoop, but wants to know more about its features.</p>

    <h3>Social networks and recommendation engines, here comes Neo4j</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-18">Jaroslaw Palka</a></p>
    <p>RDBMS, key-value stores, column family, document and time series databases, you probably know it all, played with it, used it here and there. This time I am going to show you graph database, Neo4j and how it plays nicely in such domains like social networks and recommendation engines. I truly believe graphs are the ultimate data model, which directly translates into your brain cells and the ways we human think, they are natural for us. So if you mix it powerful query language called Cypher, you could conquer the world with tricky queries. During the talk I will show two data models, my email inbox and movie recommendations, how to model them as graphs and how to build layers of information and knowledge using graphs, nodes, materialized relations and indexes.</p>

    <h3>MyBatis, Thanks God not JPA</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-12">Vladislav Zablotsky</a></p>
    <p>Nowadays there are plenty different implementations over JPA. Comparing to JDBC JPA has many advantages and can simplify development in some way. But everything comes with a price. Do we really need such huge frameworks to simplify our DB interactions? The answer is No. All you need to know is SQL, MyBatis will do the rest with almost no extra coding.</p>

    <h3>Improve your tests quality with Mutation Testing</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-20">Nicolas Frankel</a></p>
    <p>Unit testing ensures your production code is relevant. But what does ensure your testing code is relevant? Come discover mutation testing and make sure your never forget another assert again. <br/> In the realm of testing, the code coverage metrics is the most often talked about. However, it doesn't mean that the test has been useful or even that an assert has been coded. Mutation testing is a strategy to make sure that the test code is relevant. <br/> In this talk, I will explain how Code Coverage is computed and what its inherent flaw is. Afterwards, I will describe how Mutation Testing work and how it helps pointing out code that is tested but leave out corner cases. I will also demo PIT, a Java production-grade framework that enables Mutation Testing on a simple code base. If time allows, a demo will also show how PIT can be integrated with Sonar.</p>

    <h3>Testing RESTful services: The What, The How and The Automated</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-21">Alexey Buzdin</a></p>
    <p>Nowadays REST is a default architectural pattern for developing web services. But with great power comes great responsibility! Let's talk about what should be pinpointed and tested on a RESTful API level, what are the tips and tricks, where you could stumble upon common problems and what are the options on writing a beautifully crafted, maintainable test suit with Java or without. Furthermore let's talk about how to automate the whole beast to fit your delivery pipeline.</p>

    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-22">Tomasz Borek</a></p>
    <p>JUnit 5.0.0-ALPHA was released on February 1st, 2016. It went forward with large strides and has incorporated number of features only TestNG had so far (grouping tests, for instance). I'd like to NOT leave the IDE and show you number of those. <br/> We'll cover parametrized testing with JUnit 5 and older, via Zohhak or JUnitParams. We'll talk about database testing with DBUnit, DataBene Benerator, LiquiBase and Spring Data. <br/ >We'll delve into interesting things like system tests (for system-wide concerns) and some tools for NON-functional requirements, like system stability or high reliability or speed. <br/> I'll cover many tools, but due to limited time, none will be covered in-depth (as each would have taken whole session if that were to happen). Each tool will be covered with less-experienced audience in mind, so that usage and benefits would be clear.</p>

    <h3>How to get rid of Obsession?</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-23">Sebastian Malaca</a></p>
    <p>Being obsessed means "to preoccupy or fill the mind of (someone) continually and to a troubling extent". SOLID, design patterns, KISS, DRY, GRASP, high cohesion and low coupling, refactoring, testing, code review, etc. And all of this for the sake of code's quality and maintainability. All of this for the sake of code's perfection. <br/> You have to take care of the code, but you also have to know when you can leave it as it is.</p>

    <h3>Kotlin: Making JVM Development Fun Again</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-24">Dmitry Jemerov</a></p>
    <p>Kotlin is a new programming language recently released by JetBrains. Kotlin's key values include pragmatism, clarity, safety and 100% Java interoperability. Kotlin works great everywhere where Java is being used today, including server-side enterprise development and Android apps. In this talk, I'll introduce you to the language and the tools which are available for it, and give you a tour of the language's syntax and main distinguishing features.</p>

    <h3>Kotlin in real projects: pragmatic opinion on pragmatic language</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-25">Anton Keks</a></p>
    <p>Kotlin is a marvelous JVM language that many have waited for. While we already have Java 8 and some people have migrated away from JVM while waiting for a more productive language, Kotlin finally is here, promising lots of good stuff, but still allowing us to use the cross-platform and highly optimized JVM and many of familiar frameworks. <br/> However, nothing comes without drawbacks. There have been some controversial decisions while designing the language that affect what is convenient to do in the language and what is not so. Moreover, Kotlin is yet to deliver many of its promises, like compilation speed. <br/> In this talk I'll talk about real life experience of using Kotlin in an Agile way, the obstacles that you may encounter and how to overcome them.</p>

    <h3>Developing Modular Software: Welcome to Hell!</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-14">Baruch Sadogursky</a></p>
    <p>Using software modules today is the default way of working for most systems and frameworks. With the advent of many software languages and OSS frameworks, new module systems are constantly created and new module ecosystems start to prevail. This trend is horizontal and covers operating system packages, language libraries and application modules (plugins). But while some module systems are nicer to use, others are repeating past mistakes and are a daily source for developer agony and pain. In this short talk I will present the "lessons learned" at JFrog, where we make software for managing software libraries and deal with many types of module systems. This talk will show what works and what doesn't work in a module system; what features can make a module ecosystem thrive or fail; and why, despite all downsides, modules are here to stay and conquer more space as the Cloud continues to grow.</p>

    <h3>A Language is More Than a Language</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-27">Bruce Eckel</a></p>
    <p>In the early days, you always purchased your compiler. The language and implementation decisions were controlled by the vendor for their own ends. Programming was often an isolated process. Your code was your own. You wrote it, tested it (or not) and consumed it in relative obscurity. With the rise of open source, programming languages are designed in public, implementations are free, and much of the code you write is public. Coding is now a community activity. For a new language to be successful, it must first become an entire ecosystem, including extensive standard libraries, a build tool, a test framework, a code formatting style and checking tool, and now even a package manager and official repository for add-on libraries. This has become the standard checklist for considering a new language. But that's still not enough. We now expect a language to have a code of conduct and a friendly community, and that requires leaders to develop a culture of kindness. In this presentation, I will look at a number of programming languages and the ways that they have succeeded or failed in creating ecosystems.</p>

    <h3>Java in production for Data Mining Research projects</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-17">Alexey Zinoviev</a></p>
    <p>Java is often criticized for hard parsing CSV datasets, poor matrix and vectors manipulations. This makes it hard to easy and efficiently implement certain types of machine learning algorithms. In many cases data scientists choose R or Python languages for modeling and problem solution and you as a Java developer should rewrite R algorithms in Java or integrate many small Python scripts in Java application. <br/> But why so many highload tools like Cassandra, Hadoop, Giraph, Spark are written in Java or executed on JVM? What the secret of successful implementation and running? Maybe we should forget old manufacturing approach of dividing on developers and research engineers in production projects? <br/> During the report, we will discuss how to build full Java-stack Data Mining application, deploy it, make charts, integrate with databases, how to improve performance with JVM tuning and etc. <br/> Attendees of my talk will become familiar with the development and deploy of an research Java projects, Hadoop/Spark basics and will get useful tips about possible integration ways.</p>

    <h3>Spring The Ripper</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-28">Evgeny Borisov</a></p>
    <p>Why should we know about Spring internals? It works! So use it and enjoy! However, as always, in order to use Spring in most efficient way, you must know, what is under the fork. Only in case you really understand its internals you will be able to use all power of Spring. You will be able to customize this framework according to challenges of your project, to achieve best performance and solve any problem without applying to Spring-support center. <br/> <br/> During the talk following topics will be covered: <ul> <li>How does Spring impact the performance of your application?</li> <li>What are the phases of Spring lifecycle?</li> <li>What is ApplicationContext structure?</li> <li>“You can’t do it with Spring!” – or maybe you can?</li> </ul></p>

    <h3>TDD for database related code, how is it possible?</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-29">Mikalai Alimenkou</a></p>
    <p>TDD style proved itself as very reliable and quick way of business tasks solving with code. But most of examples on trainings and in the internet show how to apply TDD to simple input/output code or interface based dependencies with mocking techniques. What about other areas of application development like database related code? Could it be developed with TDD style? What does TDD bring to developer? I will try to answer these questions in my talk and show on practical examples how helpful TDD is for database code, how it reduces risks and opens the door for refactoring techniques. As bonus NoSQL solutions will be covered as well, that should make this topic popular even more!</p>

    <h3>Distributed Rate Limiter. Generic Software Engineering Practices</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-30">Uladzimir Liashkevich</a></p>
    <p>Online resources oftentimes have to deal with surge of incoming traffic. It can be caused by an increased demand of the service it provides. Slashdot effect or DDoS attack can lead to that as well. <br/> In this talk, we will consider request rate limiting pattern that one can employ in their online request processing systems to provide the initial line of defense. Several tools are already available to Java developers that can work in simple scenarios. Additional measures are required in case a distributed service accesses an external resource that has a limited capacity to handle requests. <br/> The talk also briefly covers broader topics, of how to come up with meaningful software engineering practices. This can have direct impact on developers’ day-to-day effectiveness. Besides developers, the talk can be especially interesting to team leaders and technical managers.</p>

    <h3>Java byte code in practice</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-31">Rafael Winterhalter</a></p>
    <p>At first glance, Java byte code can appear to be some low level magic that is both hard to understand and effectively irrelevant to application developers. However, neither is true. With only little practice, Java byte code becomes easy to read and can give true insights into the functioning of a Java program. In this talk, we will cast light on compiled Java code and its interplay with the Java virtual machine. In the process, we will look into the evolution of byte code over the recent major releases with features such as dynamic method invocation which is the basis to Java 8 lambda expressions. Finally, we will learn about tools for the run time generation of Java classes and how these tools are used to build modern frameworks and libraries. Among those tools, I present <a href="http://bytebuddy.net">Byte Buddy</a>, an open source tool of my own efforts and an attempt to considerably simplify run time code generation in Java.</p>

    <h3>How "final" is final?</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-4">Volker Simonis</a></p>
    <p>Altough the concept of "final" fields is quite simple, its implementation in Java can lead to surprising effects. First of all, the Java VM and Java language have a slightly different understanding of "final". Second (and unfortunately) declaring a field as final doesn't mean that the VM or the programmer can really rely on its immutability. <br/> This talk will show the differnt aspects of "finality" and their impact on the Java compiler and the Java VM. It will demonstrate how finality can be circumvented in Java with the help of reflection or sun.misc.Unsafe. And finally it will discuss the impacts this has on the optimzations done by the JIT compiler.</p>

    <h3>An introduction to JVM performance</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-31">Rafael Winterhalter</a></p>
    <p>Writing software for a virtual machine allows developers to forget about machine code assembly, interrupts and processor caches. This makes Java a convenient language, but all too many developers see the JVM as a black box and are often unsure of how to optimize their code for performance. This unfortunately adds credence to the myth that Java is always outperformed by native languages. In this talk we'll take a peek at the inner workings of the HotSpot Virtual Machine, its Just-In-Time Compiler and the interplay with a computer's hardware. From this, we will understand the more common optimizations that a virtual machine applies to be better equipped to improve and to reason about a Java program's performance, and how to correctly measure runtime!</p>

    <h3>Do we need Unsafe in Java?</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-33">Andrei Pangin</a></p>
    <p>Java platform is highly appreciated for its security features: type safety, bounds checking, access control, automatic memory management, etc. The Virtual Machine provides a managed environment to guard applications from typical run-time problems. Today, however, more and more developers opt to break the barrier and escape from JVM sandbox. There is hardly a Senior Java developer who has never heard of sun.misc.Unsafe. Though it has always been a private API intended for JDK internal use only, the popularity of Unsafe has grown too fast, and now it is used in many open-source projects. <a href="http://ok.ru">OK.RU</a> is not an exception: its software also heavily relies on Unsafe APIs. <br/>During this session we'll try to understand what is so attractive about Unsafe. Why do people keep using it regardless the warnings of removal from future JDK releases? Are there any safe alternatives to private API or is it absolutely vital? We will review the typical cases when Java developers prefer to go unsafe and discuss major benefits and the drawbacks of it. The report will be supported by the real examples from <a href="http://ok.ru">OK.RU</a> experience.</p>

    <h3>Scala perfomance for those who doubt</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-34">Roman Grebennikov</a></p>
    <p>Scala language has a lot of nifty features like pattern matching, recursion, collections with lambdas and other things from functional programming world. And all these features are combined together in a way that makes programming happier. <br/> But all these dreams about FP magic can be easily destroyed by the fact, that "when I rewrote all my spaghetti Java code to a Scala one-liner, why did it become three times slower?". Brutal reality hints us that all these modern high-level abstractions may hide monsters inside and a comfort you get by using them has it's own price. And if you develop something more complex than a simple CRUD application and it's even slightly connected with performance, you must clearly understand how do all these "monads" behave. <br/> This talk will tell you about magic performed by scala compiler, will show you a couple of horror stories about scala performance with explanations and solutions: <ul> <li> JMH and how to use it with Scala. </li> <li> What happens when you hit 'compile' button. </li> <li> Pattern-matching, tail recursion and collections under the hood. </li> <li> How HotSpot optimises your code. </li> </ul> Parental advisory: 18+, explicit x86_64 assembly inside.</p>

    <h3>Streams: reactive? functional? Or: akka- & scalaz- streams side-by-side?</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-35">Adam Warski</a></p>
    <p>Stream data processing is becoming increasingly popular, providing elegant abstractions to solve a large number of everyday problems. Plus it’s at the core of the “reactive” movement! There are two popular libraries for single-node stream processing in the Scala ecosystem: akka-stream and scalaz-stream. <br/> Both libraries share a common design goal, to provide compositionality, but they take different routes to satisfy that requirement. Akka-stream puts an emphasis on implementing the reactive streams standard and is actor-based, while scalaz-stream aims at isolating effects and providing a possibly pure FP library. <br/> During the *live-coding* presentation, we’ll implement a couple of examples using both libraries, introducing their core concepts and highlighting key differences. <br/> It will be really useful for Java developers familiar with Java 8 features to dive deeper into functionl world.</p>

    <h3>Domain-specific Hotspot Optimization with Scalan</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-36">Alexander Slesarenko</a></p>
    <p>While high-level abstractions greatly simplify program development, they ultimately need to be eliminated to produce high-performance code. <br/>I will present Scalan, a framework which enables compilation of high-level object-oriented-functional code in Scala into high-performance low-level code. <br/>Using simple examples we will look at compilation pipeline of Scalan in action. We start from DSL embedding, then discuss transformation and specialization techniques based on staged evaluation, then generation of efficient imperative code using Lightweight Modular Staging framework and finally performance evaluation and speedups.</p>

    <h3>Groovy AST Transformations: Getting practical in an hour</h3>
    <p>Speakers: <a href="#speaker-14">Baruch Sadogursky</a></p>
    <p>​If you​ know Groovy, you​ probably know ​it has very powerful AST transformations. You might although think that writing your own AST transformations is something complicated, and takes deep knowledge of academical compilers, abstract syntax tree and other neat stuff. Although for deep understanding of some advanced AST concepts that might be true, Groovy makes it super-easy to get started with creating your own magic with AST Transformations. Come to this talk to hear (but mostly see) how AST transformations work, and what it takes to write your own (hint: it won't be complicated).</p>

At the moment he works as code mangler at Allegro, recovering from long journey as chief architect of a large SaaS platform for HR solutions. He was involved in small, medium and horribly and nonsense large systems, from "waterfall" through Agile to "no methodology" methodology. It all lead him to conclusion that it doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it right, keep it simple and use the right tool to do the job for you. In the meantime he fell in love it TDD and Software Craftsmanship, explored architectures and design of legacy systems and was trapped inside JVM, till death do as apart. He also spent a lot of time exploring ideas like system thinking, system dynamics, strange attractor and complexity theory. From time to time you can hear his low quality jokes about architecture at conferences in Poland. He is also trying to make a world a better place as blog author at <a href="http://geekyprimitives.wordpress.com" target="_blank">GeekyPrimitives</a>, trainer at <a href="http://symentis.pl" target="_blank">Symentis</a> and program committee lead at 4Developers and JDD conferences.</p>
